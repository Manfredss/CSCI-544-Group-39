    note={A key challenge in medical decision making is learning treatment policies for patients with limited observational data. This challenge is particularly evident in personalized healthcare decision-making, where models need to take into account the intricate relationships between patient characteristics, treatment options, and health outcomes. To address this, we introduce prescriptive networks (PNNs), shallow 0-1 neural networks trained with mixed integer programming that can be used with counterfactual estimation to optimize policies in medium data settings. These models offer greater interpretability than deep neural networks and can encode more complex policies than common models such as decision trees. We show that PNNs can outperform existing methods in both synthetic data experiments and in a case study of assigning treatments for postpartum hypertension. In particular, PNNs are shown to produce policies that could reduce peak blood pressure by 5.47 mm Hg (p=0.02) over existing clinical practice, and by 2 mm Hg (p=0.01) over the next best prescriptive modeling technique. Moreover PNNs were more likely than all other models to correctly identify clinically significant features while existing models relied on potentially dangerous features such as patient insurance information and race that could lead to bias in treatment.}

  abstract = 	 {We study the problem of learning optimal policy from a set of discrete treatment options using observational data. We propose a piecewise linear neural network model that can balance strong prescriptive performance and interpretability, which we refer to as the prescriptive ReLU network, or P-ReLU. We show analytically that this model (i) partitions the input space into disjoint polyhedra, where all instances that belong to the same partition receive the same treatment, and (ii) can be converted into an equivalent prescriptive tree with hyperplane splits for interpretability. We demonstrate the flexibility of the P-ReLU network as constraints can be easily incorporated with minor modifications to the architecture. Through experiments, we validate the superior prescriptive accuracy of P-ReLU against competing benchmarks. Lastly, we present examples of prescriptive trees extracted from trained P-ReLUs using a real-world dataset, for both the unconstrained and constrained scenarios.}

ABSTRACT = {Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) has become a game changer in the management of severe aortic stenosis shifting the concept from inoperable or high-risk patients to intermediate or low surgical-risk individuals. Among devices available nowadays, there is no clear evidence that one device is better than the other or that one device is suitable for all patients. The selection of the optimal TAVI valve for every patient represents a challenging process for clinicians, given a large number of currently available devices. Consequently, understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each valve and personalising the valve selection based on patient-specific clinical and anatomical characteristics is paramount. This review article aims to both analyse the available devices in the presence of specific clinical and anatomic features and offer guidance to select the most suitable valve for a given patient.},
