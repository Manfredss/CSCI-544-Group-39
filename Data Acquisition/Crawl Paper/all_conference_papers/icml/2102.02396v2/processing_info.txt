摘要: Factorization-based gradient descent is a scalable and efficient algorithm
for solving low-rank matrix completion. Recent progress in structured
non-convex optimization has offered global convergence guarantees for gradient
descent under certain statistical assumptions on the low-rank matrix and the
sampling set. However, while the theory suggests gradient descent enjoys fast
linear convergence to a global solution of the problem, the universal nature of
the bounding technique prevents it from obtaining an accurate estimate of the
rate of convergence. In this paper, we perform a local analysis of the exact
linear convergence rate of gradient descent for factorization-based matrix
completion for symmetric matrices. Without any additional assumptions on the
underlying model, we identify the deterministic condition for local convergence
of gradient descent, which only depends on the solution matrix and the sampling
set. More crucially, our analysis provides a closed-form expression of the
asymptotic rate of convergence that matches exactly with the linear convergence
observed in practice. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first one
that offers the exact rate of convergence of gradient descent for matrix
factorization in Euclidean space for matrix completion.
