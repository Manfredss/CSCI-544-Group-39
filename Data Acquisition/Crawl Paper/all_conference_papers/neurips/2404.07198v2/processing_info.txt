摘要: Complex logical query answering (CLQA) in knowledge graphs (KGs) goes beyond
simple KG completion and aims at answering compositional queries comprised of
multiple projections and logical operations. Existing CLQA methods that learn
parameters bound to certain entity or relation vocabularies can only be applied
to the graph they are trained on which requires substantial training time
before being deployed on a new graph. Here we present UltraQuery, the first
foundation model for inductive reasoning that can zero-shot answer logical
queries on any KG. The core idea of UltraQuery is to derive both projections
and logical operations as vocabulary-independent functions which generalize to
new entities and relations in any KG. With the projection operation initialized
from a pre-trained inductive KG reasoning model, UltraQuery can solve CLQA on
any KG after finetuning on a single dataset. Experimenting on 23 datasets,
UltraQuery in the zero-shot inference mode shows competitive or better query
answering performance than best available baselines and sets a new state of the
art on 15 of them.
