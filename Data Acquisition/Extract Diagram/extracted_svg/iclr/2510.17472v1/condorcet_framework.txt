Given a prompt, the model generates multiple reasoning rollouts from the reference distribution $_{}(|{pr})$. The resulting terminal answers are aggregated via majority voting, viewed as mode estimation under sampling uncertainty. The Martingale Majority Certificate (MMC) monitors the empirical margin and provides an stopping rule for certification. Test-time training with SNR or entropy-based adaptation sharpens the terminal distribution, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reducing the number of samples required for certification.
