We define $H({})$ as image information, $H({A})$ and $H({B})$ as caption information; both captions only describe the information depicted in the image and contain shared and caption-specific information. We further define $C_A = I( {} ; {A} {B})$ and $C_B = I( {} ; {B} {A})$ as caption-specific information; $S = I({} ; {A} ; {B})$ as shared information; $ R = H( {} {A} , {B} ) $ as task-irrelevant information; $R = C_A + C_B + S$ as task-relevant information.
