{An overall illustration of .} Given RGB camera observations collected at different times, we use COLMAP to obtain the camera poses and initial Gaussian points. Then we utilize splatting-based rasterization to render both RGB images and robust features from the environmental Gaussians. We further leverage feature residuals to extract the object masks by mining spatial information of the residuals. Finally, we utilize the ephemerality masks to finetune the 3D Gaussians.
