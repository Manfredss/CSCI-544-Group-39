Overall architecture of proposed the Memory State-Sapce Model (MSSM). MSSM divides the transmitted information into two categories: temporal-aware information and spatial-aware information. The Dynamic Memory Bank module utilizes motion-aware layer normalization (MLN) to encode temporal-aware attributes and engages in information interaction with the dynamically updated memory bank. Meanwhile, the Static Scene Propagation module employs BEV features to represent spatial-aware latent statics, which are directly conveyed to the decoder.
