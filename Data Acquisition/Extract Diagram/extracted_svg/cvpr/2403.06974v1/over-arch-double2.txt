Overall architecture of our approach. We insert memory-based adapters after image and point cloud backbones, which cache the extracted features in memory over time and perform temporal aggregation. 3D-to-2D adapter is proposed to further exploit inter-modal temporal information. Solid lines indicate operations within a single frame, while dashed lines indicate temporal operations.
