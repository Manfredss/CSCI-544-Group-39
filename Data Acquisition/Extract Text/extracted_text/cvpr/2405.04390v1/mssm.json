  "caption": "Overall architecture of proposed the Memory State-Sapce Model (MSSM). MSSM divides the transmitted information into two categories: temporal-aware information and spatial-aware information. The Dynamic Memory Bank module utilizes motion-aware layer normalization (MLN) to encode temporal-aware attributes and engages in information interaction with the dynamically updated memory bank. Meanwhile, the Static Scene Propagation module employs BEV features to represent spatial-aware latent statics, which are directly conveyed to the decoder.",

Here's a structured breakdown of its contributions and methodology:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Components of DriveWorld**\n\n#### **a. 4D Pre-training Objective**\nDriveWorld integrates **spatio-temporal modeling** and **3D occupancy prediction** into a unified framework. The pre-training objective is formalized as a **generative probabilistic model** involving five key components:\n\n1. **BEV Representation Model**:  \n   Learns compact **Bird's Eye View (BEV)** representations from multi-camera inputs and actions.  \n   $ b_t \\sim q_\\phi(b_t \\mid o_t) $\n\n2. **Stochastic State Model**:  \n   Encodes latent states $ s_t $ (dynamic elements) based on history $ h_{t-1} $, actions $ a_{t-1} $, and observations $ o_t $.  \n   $ s_t \\sim q_\\phi(s_t \\mid h_{t-,} a_{t-1}, o_t) $\n\n3. **Dynamic Transition Model**:  \n   Predicts future states $ s_t $ from current hidden states $ h_t $ and past actions $ \\hat{a}_{t-1} $.  \n   $ s_t \\sim p_\\theta(s_t \\mid h_t, \\hat{a}_{t-1}) $\n\n4. **Static Propagation Model**:  \n   Transfers spatial information from past BEV representations $ b' $ to future representations $ \\hat{b} $.  \n   $ \\hat{b} \\sim p_\\theta(\\hat{b} \\mid b') $\n\n5. **Action Decoder & 3D Occupancy Decoder**:  \n   Decodes future actions $ \\hat{a}_t $ and 3D occupancy maps $ \\hat{y}_t $ from hidden states and spatial representations.  \n   $ \\hat{a}_t \\sim p_\\theta(\\hat{a}_t \\mid h_t, s_t) $,  \n   $ \\hat{y}_t \\sim p_\\theta(\\hat{y}_t \\mid h_t, s_t, \\hat{b}) $\n\n---\n\n### **2. Memory State-Space Model (MSSM)**\n\nThe MSSM architecture is central to DriveWorld's spatio-temporal modeling:\n\n#### **a. Dynamic Memory Bank Module**\n- **Temporal-Aware Encoding**:  \n  Uses **Motion-Aware Layer Normalization (MLN)** to encode temporal dynamics (e.g., object motion, trajectory changes).  \n- **Memory Interaction**:  \n  Maintains a dynamically updated memory bank to retain and reuse temporal context across frames.\n\n#### **b. Static Scene Propagation Module**\n- **Spatial-Aware Encoding**:  \n  Leverages **BEV features** to represent static scene elements (e.g., road structures, obstacles).  \n- **Direct Decoding**:  \n  Transmits spatial latent representations directly to the decoder for tasks like detection and segmentation.\n\n#### **c. Task Prompt Mechanism**\n- **Adaptive Task Learning**:  \n  Guides the model to acquire task-specific representations (e.g., detection, prediction) by introducing task-specific prompts during pre-training.\n\n---\n\n### **3.
