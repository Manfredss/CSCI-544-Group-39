  "extracted_context": "The relevant context for the figure caption and label \"fig3\" (flowchart of Faster Mean-shift) can be inferred from the following sections of the text:  \n\n---\n\n**1. \"Design\" Subsection (Experimental Setup):**  \n- The paper describes replacing the original CPU-based mean-shift algorithm with the proposed Faster Mean-shift. This transition involves dividing computational tasks between CPU and GPU, which is likely visualized in the flowchart.  \n- Example: *\"We replaced the original CPU version mean-shift algorithm and used our proposed Faster Mean-shift algorithm for clustering.\"*  \n\n---\n\n**2. \"Results\" Section (Time-Cost Analysis):**  \n- The discussion of parameters like $ N_{initial} $ and $ H $ (bandwidth) and their impact on computational efficiency directly relates to the algorithm's workflow.  \n- Example: *\"The time cost for different $ N_{initial} $... the influence of $ N_{initial} $ on the average computational time is small.\"*  \n\n---\n\n**3. \"Discussion\" Section (Performance Analysis):**  \n- The analysis of computational efficiency gains and trade-offs between CPU/GPU processing aligns with the flowchart's purpose of illustrating parallelization.  \n- Example: *\"Our algorithm achieved a 7-10 times speedup compared with [previous methods].\"*  \n\n---\n\n**4. \"Comparison with GPU_H and GPU_P\" (Ablation Studies):**  \n- The text explains limitations of GPU-based approaches (e.g., memory overflow for GPU_P) and how Faster Mean-shift optimizes resource allocation, which would be reflected in the flowchart's architecture.  \n- Example: *\"Due to the limitation of GPU memory, when using GPU_P, the GPU card encountered a memory overflow.\"*  \n\n---\n\n**Key Contextual Elements for fig3:**  \n- **CPU/GPU Task Division:** The flowchart likely separates CPU tasks (e.g., preprocessing, initial clustering) from GPU tasks (e.g., parallel iterations, data aggregation).  \n- **Algorithm Workflow:** Steps like embedding generation, seed initialization, and iterative clustering would be depicted.  \n- **Parameter Influence:** The roles of $ N_{initial} $ and $ H $ in controlling computational load and parallelism may be visualized.  \n\nThese sections collectively provide the technical foundation for understanding the flowchart in fig3.",
