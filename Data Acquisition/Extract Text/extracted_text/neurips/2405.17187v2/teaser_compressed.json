  "extracted_context": "The figure caption and label (\"fig:teaser\") describe the core framework of **3D Gaussian Mapping (3DGM)**, which is introduced in the paper as a **LiDAR-free, self-supervised** system for **multitraverse environment mapping** and **2D unsupervised object segmentation**. Below are the **relevant context paragraphs** from the text that align with the figure's description:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Introduction of 3DGM (Conclusion Section)**\n> \"We introduce **3D Gaussian Mapping (3DGM)**, a novel self-supervised, camera-only framework that utilizes repeated traversals for simultaneous 3D environment mapping (**EnvGS**) and 2D unsupervised object segmentation (**EmerSeg**).\"\n\nThis paragraph directly ties to the figure's description of the framework's **LiDAR-free** and **self-supervised** nature, as well as its dual tasks of **environment mapping** and **ephemerality segmentation**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Task Setup for Neural Environment Rendering**\n> \"Our **EnvGS** can also achieve novel view synthesis through splatting-based rasterization. The challenge lies in ensuring the environment rendering automatically bypasses the non-environment pixels, *i.e.*, transient objects.\"\n\nThis section explains the **Gaussian-based environment map** (EnvGS) and its goal to exclude transient objects, which is central to the figure's \"outputs a Gaussian-based environment map\" part.\n\n---\n\n### **3. EmerSeg: 2D Unsupervised Segmentation**\n> \"Additionally, we develop the **EmerSeg** method, a 2D unsupervised segmentation approach that learns to distinguish static environmental elements from transient objects using self-supervised cues from repeated traversals.\"\n\nThis paragraph details the **2D ephemerality segmentation** component (EmerSeg) mentioned in the figure caption, emphasizing its **self-supervised** and **unsupervised** nature.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Broader Impacts and Limitations**\n> \"The concept of vision-only neural representation learning through repeated traversals extends beyond object segmentation and environment mapping, benefiting the vision and robotics communities. [...] Our method can serve as a baseline for autolabeling 2D masks and has potential for 3D autolabeling with LiDAR integration.\"\n\nThis context highlights the **framework's significance** (LiDAR-free, self-supervised) and its potential applications, aligning with the figure's emphasis on **multitraverse mapping** and **ephemerality detection**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Neural Environment Rendering (Results Section)**\n> \"Our method can identify and mask out not only the objects themselves but also their associated non-environmental elements, such as shadows [...] More interestingly, our method can identify and mask out not only the objects themselves but also their associated non-environmental elements, such as shadows [...]\"\n\nThis directly supports the figure's claim about **removing transient objects** (including shadows) and the effectiveness of the framework in **environment rendering**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Components in the Figure Caption**\n- **Gaussian-based environment map** → Linked to **EnvGS** in the \"Neural Environment Rendering\" section.  \n- **2D ephemerality segmentation** → Linked to **EmerSeg** in the \"Neural Environment Rendering\" and \"Conclusion\" sections.  \n- **LiDAR-free and self-supervised** → Emphasized in the **introduction of 3DGM** and **broader impacts** section.  \n\nThese paragraphs collectively contextualize the figure's high-level overview of the framework's architecture, tasks, and methodology.",
